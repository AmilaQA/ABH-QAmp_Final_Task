1. Define Smoke Test for PlaceLab Module: Content Classification - Duplicate Detection

A smoke test is a subset of software testing that focuses on quickly and superficially validating the basic functionality of an application. The purpose of a smoke test is to determine whether the critical features and functionality of the software are working correctly after a new build or deployment.

The goal is to identify major issues or showstopper defects that would prevent further testing or usage of the application. 
Smoke tests primarily validate the positive or expected paths of the application. They ensure that the critical features are working as intended, without extensively exploring edge cases or negative scenarios.
The process of conducting a smoke test involves selecting a set of high-priority test cases that cover the essential functionality of the software. These test cases are executed, and the results are checked to determine if the application passes or fails the smoke test. 

In this case new functionality has been added - Creating Duplicate detection report.
As Smoke test suite the functionality that is going to be tested is:
1. Verify user is able to successfully create new Duplicate detection report with precondition to have valid credentials (email and password), and can successfully access https://demo.placelab.com/queries. Also to verify that user can successfully open, and delete previously created Duplicate detection report.

After executing this test case as Smoke test new PlaceLab functionality added Duplicate Detection worked properly and stable.
All test cases are created in excell file "Smoke test DDR reort - manual".
